A development environment

A development project is about to start programming. They ask you to deploy a development environment for them. They have the following requirements:

    -  One storage server with the GlusterFS server installed,  with a single CPU.

    -  One server the developers will use to write code on, with a single CPU. They have to have emacs, jed and git installed

    -  All machines have to have four users with preferred usernames:

    - bob - janet - alice - tim

    -  All four users should get root access via sudo

    -  Tim and janet have to be members of the group «developers». That group has to be created.

    -  one compile server with gcc, make and binutils installed

    -  One server running Docker for testing the software developed
